== Create packer file 'wheezy'


Format example file with `python -mjson.tool`

Grab a baseline preseed file from: https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt

For diagnostics set:

    export PACKER_LOG=anything

And then build like so:

    packer build wheezy.json |& tee packer.out

which results in:

    output-virtualbox-iso
    |-- debian-7.8.0-amd64-disk1.vmdk
    `-- debian-7.8.0-amd64.ovf

This is completely unprovisioned at this point.
